class NotFittedError(ValueError, AttributeError):

    This class inherits from both ValueError and AttributeError to help with
    exception handling and backward compatibility.

class DataConversionWarning(UserWarning):
    """Warning used to notify implicit data conversions happening in the code.
    This warning occurs when some input data needs to be converted or
    interpreted in a way that may not match the user's expectations.
    For example, this warning may occur when the user
        - passes an integer array to a function which expects float input and
          will convert the input
        - requests a non-copying operation, but a copy is required to meet the
          implementation's data-type expectations;
        - passes an input whose shape can be interpreted ambiguously.

       Moved from sklearn.utils.validation.
